# Delegation
This contract is meant to be used with [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702): Set Code for EOAs. After the Ethereum Pectra fork, Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) can now internalize code at a remotely deployed smart contract address. This process is called **delegation.**
For simplicity, we will refer to these EOAs as _users_ and these remote smart contracts as _implementations._ The term _Smart Wallet_ will refer to the Uniswap smart wallet product.
Users can only be delegated to one contract at a time but can have other delegations on different chains.
After a user is delegated, they can execute transactions using the logic defined in the contract implementation, enabling advanced features like transaction batching, gas-less transactions, and custom permission controls - all while keeping their original address and on-chain history.
